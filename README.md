# Django Courier

**Under heavy development. You have been warned.**

This package manages notification providers for django installations.

Right now, it only supports onesignal for notifications. 

### Settings

Right now, it only needs the following settings:

- `COURIER_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`- Must be `onesignal`
- `COURIER_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` - Your onesignal app id
- `COURIER_ONESIGNAL_USER_ID` - Your Onesignal User id
